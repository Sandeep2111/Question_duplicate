Question duplicates
The task of identifying duplicated questions can be viewed as an instance of the paraphrase identification problem, 
which is a well-studied NLP task that uses natural language sentence matching (NLSM) to determine whether two sentences 
are paraphrase or not (2). This task has wide array of useful NLP application. For example, in question-and-answer (QA) forums,
there are vast numbers of duplicate questions. Identifying these duplicates and consolidating their answers increases the efficiency
of such QA forums. Moreover, identifying questions with the same semantic content could help web-scale question answering systems
that are increasingly concentrating on retrieving focused answers to usersâ€™ queries.

In this project, we focus on a dataset published by Quora.com containing over 400K annotated question pairs containing binary paraphrase labels.1 .
We believe that this dataset presents a great opportunity for the NLP practitioners tue to its scale and quality; 
it can result in systems that accurately identify duplicate questions, thus increasing the quality of many QA forums.
